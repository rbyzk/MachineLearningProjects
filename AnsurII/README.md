# 🧬 Ethnicity Prediction from Body Metrics – ANSUR II

This project explores the predictive power of anthropometric data using the **ANSUR II** dataset — a comprehensive U.S. Army survey that includes over 90 body measurements. The goal is to classify individuals' ethnicity using supervised machine learning models and interpret the results with explainability tools like **SHAP**.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Cleaned and analyzed **6,000+ samples** of real military anthropometric data  
- ⚖️ Handled **class imbalance** and missing values  
- 🤖 Trained multiple ML models: **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM**  
- 📊 Evaluated performance using **accuracy**, **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**, and **confusion matrices**  
- 🧠 Visualized model explainability using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**

## 📁 Dataset: ANSUR II

- 👥 **Subjects**: 6,068 U.S. Army personnel  
- 📏 **Measurements**: 93 body metrics (height, limb lengths, head sizes, etc.)  
- 🌍 **Target**: `DODRace` – Ethnic group category  
- ⚠️ Note: 3D scan data not included in public release

## 📊 Methods Used

- 📦 Scikit-learn Pipelines  
- 🧹 Preprocessing (imputation, scaling, encoding)  
- 🔎 Feature Selection  
- 🔁 Cross-validation and model tuning  
- 📈 SHAP for model explainability
