# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

This repository is dedicated to applied machine learning solutions for real-world problems. Each project demonstrates a complete pipeline — from data cleaning and preprocessing to model selection, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 📝 Overview

Machine learning is at the heart of data-driven decision making. These projects showcase:

- End-to-end pipelines with real or open-source datasets  
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning  
- Algorithm comparisons for classification and regression tasks  
- Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score  
- Explainability tools such as SHAP and feature importance plots

All notebooks are built with Python and written to be educational, reproducible, and easy to adapt to your own datasets.
